   ```json
   {
     "host": "10.35.233.76",

     "username": "quiz_user",
     "password": "your_actual_mysql_password",

### 4. Optional: Setup Admin Subdomain (15 minutes)

For a more professional setup, configure `admin.11seconds.de`:

1. **DNS Configuration:** Add A record or CNAME for `admin` subdomain in Netcup control panel
2. **Hosting Setup:** Create subdomain pointing to `/httpdocs/admin` directory
3. **SSL Setup:** Ensure SSL certificate covers the subdomain
4. **Test:** Access `https://admin.11seconds.de/` and verify functionality

**See [SUBDOMAIN-SETUP.md](SUBDOMAIN-SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.**
