# 11 SECONDS PROJECT - PERMANENT CONSTRAINTS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT CONSTRAINT ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NO BACKEND SERVER - STATIC HOSTING ONLY**

### What This Means:

- ‚ùå NO Node.js server
- ‚ùå NO Express.js endpoints
- ‚ùå NO /api/\* routes
- ‚ùå NO server-side JavaScript
- ‚ùå NO backend processes

### What We CAN Use:

- ‚úÖ PHP files (your hosting supports PHP)
- ‚úÖ Direct database connections from PHP
- ‚úÖ Static React build files
- ‚úÖ Client-side JavaScript only
- ‚úÖ MySQL database (direct PHP connection)

### For Authentication (Google OAuth):

**SOLUTION**: Use Google OAuth with client-side only implementation:

1. Google Sign-In JavaScript SDK (client-side)
2. Direct PHP endpoints for user management
3. Store user data in MySQL via PHP
4. Session management via PHP only

### For User Registration:

**SOLUTION**:

1. Client-side form validation
2. Direct PHP form processing
3. MySQL user storage via PHP

## üö® REMINDER FOR AI ASSISTANT üö®

**BEFORE SUGGESTING ANY FEATURE:**

1. Can this work with static hosting only?
2. Does this require a permanent server process?
3. Can this be implemented with PHP + MySQL + client-side JS only?

**IF ANY ANSWER IS "NO" - DO NOT SUGGEST IT!**

---

This constraint exists because:

- Netcup hosting is shared hosting (no permanent Node.js processes)
- Budget constraints (no VPS/dedicated server)
- Maintenance simplicity (no server management)
- Deployment simplicity (FTP upload only)
